My name is Steven, I am a mechatronics engineering student studying at the University of Melbourne. I completed my Bachelor of Science degree at the end of 2017, and will begin my Masters of Engineering course at the start of 2018.

My passion includes coding, robotics, photography and cinematography. I am constantly looking out for fresh ideas and opportunities which can broaden my perspective and network.

For more photography content, I can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenlee090/) and [500px](https://500px.com/stevenlee090). Feel free to reach out to me via any of the listed methods in the '[Home]({{ site.url }})' page. I am always open for some in-depth discussions!
