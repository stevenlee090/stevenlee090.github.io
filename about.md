I am a software engineer, with some background in mechatronics, robotics and machine learning. I intend to use this blog to share thoughts on things I come across in life.

For more photography content, I can be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/stevenlee090/) and [500px](https://500px.com/stevenlee090).
