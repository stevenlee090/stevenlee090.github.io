Here is a list of useful shortcuts which was compiled through the LabVIEW Core 1 and Core 2 exercises.

`Control T`:  View front panel and block diagram at the same time

`Control E`:  Switch between front panel window and block diagram without tiling the windows

`Control H`:  Open the context help window

`Control R`:  Run the VI

`Control Space`:  Open the quick drop dialog box, this basically allows you to search and place the item needed, provided you know what the item is called.

`Control B`:  Delete all broken wires

`Control U`:  Reroutes all existing wires and rearranges objects on the block diagram automatically

`Control Click` an Input: Switches the input around.
E.g. Click on an input of a 'subtract' block to switch the inputs around.

`Double Click`: Creates a free label/comment.

When blocks are selected, hold `shift` when pressing arrow keys to move them in five pixel increments.
