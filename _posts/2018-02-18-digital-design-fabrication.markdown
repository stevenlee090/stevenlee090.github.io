Out of curiosity, I decided to take an architecture elective called “Digital Design and Fabrication” (DDF in short) in 2017 semester one. I did not expect much walking into the first lecture. However, as the project began, I started to learn more about 3D modelling in [Rhino](https://www.rhino3d.com), and laying out documents in [Adobe InDesign](https://www.adobe.com/products/indesign.html).

Throughout the project, my photography experience proved to be useful in many occasions, as it was vital to present the models accurately and elegantly. I was  fortunate for being able to work in a diverse team consisting of people from different backgrounds and majors. Even though we had some arguments and disagreements regarding the initial project proposal, most criticisms were generally constructive and had a positive influence on the direction of the project.

Thinking back, this is definitely one of the most enjoyable projects I have ever completed. While I did not like the fact that it was a bit rushed (all done within 10 weeks), most aspects of the project were enjoyable, especially when coupled with photo shoots and editing. Furthermore, I would like to thank my tutor (Amanda) and guest critic (Chen) for always providing my group with constructive criticisms and that final push for quality content creation.

My final journal documenting the whole project can be found in the following link:
