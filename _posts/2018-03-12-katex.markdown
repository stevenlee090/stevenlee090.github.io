description: Testing out KaTeX with Jekyll.
---

After finishing up other tasks for the day, I started looking into how I could incorportate mathematical equations into the blog. Digging through various online discussions reveal the two popular choices which work well with GitHub pages and Jekyll.

* MathJax
* KaTeX

While MathJax more full-featured, KaTeX is amazingly fast, as evident in [this speed test](https://www.intmath.com/cg5/katex-mathjax-comparison.php). Therefore, I decided to try and install KaTeX and see how well it works.

The installation was not exactly straightforward, but following [this guide](https://nealde.github.io/blog/2017/10/20/How-to-make-a-local-Jekyll-website/), I was able to setup KaTeX and have it up and running. However, there are still some features which are still not working as intended, including:

* Matrix equations not working at the moment
* Equations in display math mode does not centre

Even though the KaTeX setup is only partially working at this stage, I believe the existing setup would be sufficient for my current and near future needs. Despite spending hours trying to find the solutions for the issues outlined above, the investigation still did not yield any conclusive result.

For now, I will stick to using equations such as the ones shown below:

$$ P(x)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma ^2}} $$

Another example:

$$ \int u \frac{dv}{dx}\,dx=uv-\int \frac{du}{dx}v\,dx $$

### Examples by using MathJax

Here I have some examples taken from the MathJax [Demo Page](http://www.mathjax.org/demos/tex-samples/).

#### The Lorentz Equations

\\[
\begin{aligned}
\dot{x} & = \sigma(y-x) \\\
\dot{y} & = \rho x - y - xz \\\
\dot{z} & = -\beta z + xy
\end{aligned}
\\]

#### The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality

$$ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right) $$

#### A Cross Product Formula

\\[\mathbf{V}_1 \times \mathbf{V}_2 =  \begin{vmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0
\end{vmatrix} \\]

\\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial u} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial u} & 0 \\\
\frac{\partial X}{\partial v} &  \frac{\partial Y}{\partial v} & 0
\end{bmatrix}
\\]


#### The probability of getting \\(k\\) heads when flipping \\(n\\) coins is

$$ P(E) = {n \choose k} p^k (1-p)^{ n-k} $$

#### An Identity of Ramanujan

\\[ \frac{1}{\Bigl(\sqrt{\phi \sqrt{5}}-\phi\Bigr) e^{\frac25 \pi}} =
1+\frac{e^{-2\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-4\pi}} {1+\frac{e^{-6\pi}}
{1+\frac{e^{-8\pi}} {1+\ldots} } } } \\]

#### A Rogers-Ramanujan Identity

\\[  1 +  \frac{q^2}{(1-q)}+\frac{q^6}{(1-q)(1-q^2)}+\cdots =
\prod_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(1-q^{5j+2})(1-q^{5j+3})},
\quad\quad \text{for $|q|<1$}. \\]


#### Maxwell&#8217;s Equations

\\[  \begin{aligned}
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{B}} -\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{E}}}{\partial t} & = \frac{4\pi}{c}\vec{\mathbf{j}} \\\   \nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{E}} & = 4 \pi \rho \\\
\nabla \times \vec{\mathbf{E}}\, +\, \frac1c\, \frac{\partial\vec{\mathbf{B}}}{\partial t} & = \vec{\mathbf{0}} \\\
\nabla \cdot \vec{\mathbf{B}} & = 0 \end{aligned}
\\]
