description: Setup of GitHub Pages and Jekyll
---

Over the past two to three days, I have dedicated a significant amount of time for me to familiarise myself with GitHub Pages and Jekyll. Even though there were some minor roadblocks along the way, this was definitely worth it in the end. In this process, I learnt how to setup my own website for free, and also reconsolidated my understand of GitHub operations.

I would highly recommend anyone who is interested to try out GitHub Page & Jekyll. There are plenty of great tutorials out there which makes this process relatively easy to learn, even for people who do not have extensively programming backgrounds. The most beginner friendly tutorial is [this one](https://evanwill.github.io/go-go-ghpages/), as it explains almost everything from scratch.
