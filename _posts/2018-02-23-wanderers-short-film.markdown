For the past few years, I have devoted a significant portion of my spare time to pursue my interests in photography and cinematography. This journey has been very taught me more than I have ever imagined.

I would like to highlight two particular short films which caught my attention, first one being the short film *Wanderers* which depicts humanity's expansion into outer space, colonising habitable planets and conducting interstellar travels. As a fan of [Interstellar](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0816692/), I really enjoyed watching this short film. All the scenes were coupled with perfect narration and background music, making this one of my favourite short films.

The second short film had a rather interesting origin, as it was originally filmed to [help sell a 1996 Honda Accord](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/7ae860/my_girlfriend_needs_to_sell_her_car_to_help_her_i/). This project became rather popular across various popular sites such as [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/4/16607220/honda-accord-luxury-is-a-state-of-mind-car-commercial-watch) when it was uploaded. The production quality was professional, with some humorous terms and conditions towards the end.

Ultimately, these two short films have set my benchmark for the videos and cinematography projects which I will be working on in the future.
