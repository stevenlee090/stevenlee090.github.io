## Gyroscope Motion Simulation
For the past few days, I have been working on a group project which is focused on modelling, simulating and animating the dynamic system of a gyroscope. The gyroscope used is composed of two rigid bodies, the frame and the rotor. The system has four degrees of freedom.

Currently testing MathJax equations:
$ y = x^2 $

$$ y = x^2 $$
